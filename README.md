## The Challenge

A new Frontend application is being built to spec by a crack team of coders out in orbit around Eros. You are part of that team, and your mission is to develop a UI where Eros leadership team can upload a PDF and manipulate its structure! They have a 618 page pdf that's order is out of wack. They need to edit, rearrange, and delete some pages in the pdf, so they can ask for more budget!


Clone this repo, create a branch, follow engineering best practices. Consider tests for any functions you write. There is a sample pdf attached that can be used for testing (apollo 17 flight plan)


### 1. Add functionality to load a PDF

### 2. Add functionality to rearrange PDF's pages.

### 3. Add functionality to delete pages.
